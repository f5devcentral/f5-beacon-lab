Configure Beacon & Ingest Data
==============================

Overview
--------

In this section we will configure various ways of ingesting metrics into Beacon. These methods will include Beacon Monitors, F5 Products, 3rd party integrations, and generic telemetry.  The more data that is sent into Beacon, the more valueable the data becomes. You can begin to correlate metrics across services and functions within an application architecture.

Examples
--------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   ingest/*
