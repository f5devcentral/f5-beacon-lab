Demo Scenarios
==============

Overview
--------

In this section, we will review different examples of environment changes within the **Bacon** application. Typically this will involve running a script on the Control server through VSCODE which will cause CPU spikes, traffic drops, VirtualServer failures, etc. At that point we will review how Beacon will help you identify where to start looking for the issue. The goal is to highlight Beacons ability to reduce Mean-time-to-Innocense (MTTI) and Mean-time-to-Know (MTTK).
